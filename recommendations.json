  "profile_tagline": "A deep thinker who grounds abstract ideas in tangible reality.",
  "profile_summary": "This profile combines the INTP's love for logical systems and theoretical models with the RIASEC 'Investigative' drive for research and the 'Realistic' preference for practical, hands-on application. You are likely someone who isn't just satisfied with knowing *how* something works in theory, but also feels compelled to build, test, or apply it in the real world.",
  "strengths": [
    "Deep analytical and problem-solving skills.",
    "Ability to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical implementation.",
    "Independent and self-sufficient in research and execution.",
    "High standard for accuracy and logical consistency."
  ],
  "potential_challenges": [
    "May become overly focused on theoretical details, delaying practical action.",
    "Can be skeptical of established procedures without logical proof.",
    "May prefer working alone, sometimes missing collaborative insights.",
    "Struggles with emotionally-driven or subjective decision-making."
